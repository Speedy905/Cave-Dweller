# Cave-Dweller

About this project
------------------

This is an [ICS4U project](https://sites.google.com/site/mrliconti/ics4u-python/ics4u-problem-set-3) that was designed to teach us more about project management. 
We were tasked to create a python game, based on the python plugin [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

As with the project, we were also tasked to create a [website](https://sites.google.com/site/projectcaves/) to promote the game.

This has been uploaded here for archival reasons and is under the [MIT license](LICENSE). 

I may or may not update the scripts in the future. 

Plot
----

Quoted from the original [readme](project_cavedweller_read_me.txt) file:

```
The end is nigh for DiCaprio the Bear, who has been welcomed home to a 
invasion. His year's supply of hibernation food has been stolen leaving him 
with a bare  home. Now, DiCaprio must set out of his journey and travel to 
his different friends and their cave residences in the hopes of scavenging 
food to survive his journey throughout the winter. 
```
